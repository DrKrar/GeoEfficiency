# Accurate Geometrical Efficiency Calculator (GeoEfficiency)

The Package `GeoEfficiency`, an officially registered Julia program, provides a set of tools  to calculate the geometrical efficiency in a fast and accurate way. 
The Package models a radiation detector irradiated by a radiative source. 
The Package relay directly on numerical evaluation of closed form analytical formula describing the geometrical efficiency.

## Requirements
 *  Julia 0.6 or above.
 *  QuadGK 0.1.2 or above, will be installed automatically while the package Installtion.

## Download and Install the Package
The package is registered in an officially METADATA.jl and so can be installed with Pkg.add.

	Pkg.add("GeoEfficiency") 
	
## Quick Usage

	using GeoEfficiency
	calc()
	
for more try also `geoEff()`, `calcN()`, `batch()`
	

## Package Overview
The following constructor can be used to construct a specific type of detector 
 *  `CylDetector` for cylindrical detector, 
 *  `BoreDetector` for bore hole, 
 *  `WellDetector` for well type detector.

 While the function `Detector` can be used to construct any of the above types. You may try also `getDetectors`.


`Point` constructor is used to construct an anchoring point of a source relative to it its position to the detector is specified.
For a point source, the anchoring point is the source itself. 
The `source()` method take input from the `console` and return a tuple describing the source.


The efficiency calculation can be done by one of the functions: 
 *  `geoEff` used with or without argument(s), 
 *  `calc` ask for the required information from the `console`, 
 *  `calcN` just a repeat of the `calc` function 
 *  batch() which try to take required information from csv files located in the home directory inside a folder called `GeoEfficiency`.
 
For more on the function and its methods prrfix the name of the function by `?`.

### note
   Input from the `console` can be numerical expression not just a number.
   
   > 5/2, 5//2, pi, e, 1E-2, 5.2/3, sin(1), pi/2/3
   > All are valid expressions.
	
## Batch Calculation
the pachage can be used to perform patch calculation by calling the one of the methods of the function `batch()`. The output results of batch calculations is found in `GeoEfficiency\results` folder inside the user account home.

For example	`c:\users\yourusername\GeoEfficiency\results\`.

The function `batch()` can be called withs or without arrangement. 
The without argument version relay on previously prepared Comma Saved  Values [CSV] files, that can be easily edit by Microsoft Excel, located in the `GeoEfficiency` folder.

Those Comma Saved  Values [CSV] files are:-

 *  `Detectors.csv` contains the detectors description; The line format is: 

     Crystal_Radius | Crystal_Length | Hole_Radius | Hole_Depth
     ----------------| -----------------|---------------|--------------

     > The program expect each line to contain at least one number or at most four separated numbers.

 *  `srcHeights.csv` contains the source heights; 

     Source_Heights | 
      -----------------|

     > The program expect each line to contain one number.

 *  `srcRhos.csv` contains the source off-axis distances; 	 				

     Source_Rhos | 
      -----------------|

     > The program expect each line to contain one number.

 *  `srcRadii.csv` contains the source radii for disc and cylindrical sources; 			

     Source_Radii| 
      -----------------|

     > The program expect each line to contain one number.

 *  `srcLengths.csv` contains the source length for cylindrical sources; 	

     Source_Lengths| 
      -----------------|

     > The program expect the line to contain one number.
     
### note
    For Comma Saved  Values [CSV] files each line represent an entry, the first line is always treated as the header.
